*** __Goal__ ***  
This project aims to solve the ongoing issue of understanding frame data in the video game TEKKEN 7 
by using an interactive GUI that presents the necessary information in a user-friendly manner.    
  <br/>
  
*** __Setup__ ***  
To use the TEKKEN Frame Data Visualizer interface, you will need to download all files in the repository.
Make sure all files are located in the same directory. Then, run ```main.py``` using your preferred Python compiler.  
  <br/>  

*** __Usage__ ***  
To maximize the interface's use, ensure you follow the steps below.
- You will need to first choose your character and the opponent's character from the dropdown menus.
- To find the properties of a given move, find and click the notation of the move in the moveset listbox.
- Adjust your character's *frame advantage* accordingly using the slider at the top of the interface.
- Press the respective buttons to calculate the subset of your opponents moves that your selected move
  *wins against*, *trades with*, or *loses to*, sorted ascendingly in order of *startup frames*.
- For more immersion, you can modify the sort method from the default *heap sort* [O(nÂ·logn)] to *insertion sort* [O(n<sup>2</sup>)]
  by changing the true/false values of the respective boolean variables in the first few lines of ```main.py```.
